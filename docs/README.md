## **Push_swap**

The **Push_swap** project sorts a list of integers using only **push**, **swap**, **rotate**, and **reverse rotate** operations. 

The goal is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm with a minimal number of operations.

In this implementation, I use the [Turk Algorithm](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97) to optimize the sorting process.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Push**: Move the top element from one stack to another.
- **Swap**: Swap the top two elements of a stack.
- **Rotate**: Shift all elements of the stack up by one position.
- **Reverse Rotate**: Shift all elements of the stack down by one position.

### **Turk Algorithm Overview**

The [Turk Algorithm](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97) minimizes the number of operations needed to sort the stack. It works by:

- Finding the median of the stack.
- Partitioning the stack into two parts (larger and smaller than the median).
- Sorting the larger half of the stack.
- Merging the stacks back together.
